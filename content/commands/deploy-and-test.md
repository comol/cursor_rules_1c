# /deploy-and-test — deploy to test infobase + UI tests

Deploy the current configuration to the test infobase defined in `.dev.env`, then optionally run UI tests in the web client at `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL`. UI testing is an opt-in step gated by `UI_TESTING`; see Step 4.

When `EXTENSION_NAMES` is filled and the user asked to deploy the full snapshot ("all" / "with extensions"), Steps 2–3 run as multiple passes — main configuration, then each extension in order — per `/update1cbase → Full-snapshot mode` (`content/commands/update1cbase.md`); everything else in this command is unchanged.

## Step 0. Check `.dev.env` parameters

`.dev.env` is the single source of truth for all parameters (created by the 1c-rules installer at the project root). If it is missing, ask the user to run `install.ps1 init` or copy `.dev.env.example` to `.dev.env`.

If the project still has legacy `infobasesettings.md`, migrate values to `.dev.env`, preserving already-filled `.dev.env` keys, and delete the legacy file after successful migration. The ruleset has no other location for connection settings or the web publication URL.

Parameters, classes and defaults — `content/rules/dev-standards-env.md §1`; Defaulted keys are never asked for. Keys read: `PLATFORM_PATH`, `INFOBASE_PATH` (**blocking** — if either is empty, ask once and write the value to `.dev.env`), `INFOBASE_KIND`, `IB_USER` / `IB_PASSWORD`, `EXTENSION_NAME`, `EXTENSION_NAMES` (full-snapshot deploy), `EXPORT_PATH`, `EXTENSIONS_PATH`, `LOG_PATH`, `RESULT_PATH`, `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL` and `UI_TESTING` (Step 4), `IBCMD_CONFIG`.

When substituting `.dev.env` values into the templates below, resolve `{INFOBASE_FLAG}` once from the effective `INFOBASE_KIND` (`/F` for `file`, `/S` for `server`; reject any other value), and substitute resolved `{LOG_PATH}` / `{RESULT_PATH}` values that contain `$env:` double-quoted — single quotes do not expand it. Delete a stale `{RESULT_PATH}` file before every Designer launch.

Before running, make sure `{EXPORT_PATH}` contains dumped configuration sources (for example, `Configuration.xml` at the root or in the extension subdirectory). If no sources exist, stop and tell the user.

**EDT gate:** when `.dev.env` `USE_EDT=true`, the same source-format check as `/update1cbase` applies — Steps 2–3 load a Designer XML dump, not an EDT `src/**/*.mdo` tree, and only one deployment owner (this command **or** EDT's `update_database`) may act on the infobase in a run. Canon — `content/rules/edt-workflow.md`.

This command uses forced session termination while applying the DB configuration. The target must be an explicitly identified dev/test infobase. If the current context does not establish that, stop before Step 3 and ask the user to confirm the target; never infer that an arbitrary `.dev.env` points to a test base.

## Step 1. Choose tool: `ibcmd` or Designer

1. Check whether the utility exists: `Test-Path '{PLATFORM_PATH}\bin\ibcmd.exe'`.
2. Check whether `IBCMD_CONFIG` is filled in `.dev.env`.
3. If **both conditions are true**, use **Steps 2a and 3a (`ibcmd`)**.
4. Otherwise use **Steps 2b and 3b (Designer)**.

`ibcmd infobase config` does not apply to 1C cluster infobases; for server cluster infobases always use Designer.

## Step 2a. Load configuration through `ibcmd` (preferred)

```powershell
& '{PLATFORM_PATH}\bin\ibcmd.exe' infobase config import `
    --config='{IBCMD_CONFIG}' `
    --user='{IB_USER}' `
    --password='{IB_PASSWORD}' `
    --extension={EXTENSION_NAME} `
    '{EXPORT_PATH}' *>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath '{LOG_PATH}'
```

Remove empty optional keys (`--user`, `--password`, `--extension`). On errors, show the relevant log fragment and **do not run** Step 3a.

## Step 3a. Update DB structure through `ibcmd`

```powershell
& '{PLATFORM_PATH}\bin\ibcmd.exe' infobase config apply `
    --config='{IBCMD_CONFIG}' `
    --user='{IB_USER}' `
    --password='{IB_PASSWORD}' `
    --force `
    --dynamic=auto `
    --session-terminate=force `
    --extension={EXTENSION_NAME} *>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath '{LOG_PATH}'
```

`--session-terminate=force` forcibly terminates active sessions. It is allowed only after the dev/test confirmation above. On production, replace it with `--session-terminate=prompt` (or remove the key; default is `auto`) and agree on an update window with the user.

Read `{LOG_PATH}`. On errors, show the relevant log fragment and **do not run** UI tests. Continue to **Step 4**.

## Step 2b. Load configuration through Designer (fallback)

```powershell
& '{PLATFORM_PATH}\bin\1cv8.exe' DESIGNER `
    {INFOBASE_FLAG} '{INFOBASE_PATH}' `
    /N '{IB_USER}' `
    /P '{IB_PASSWORD}' `
    /DisableStartupMessages `
    /LoadConfigFromFiles '{EXPORT_PATH}' `
    -Extension {EXTENSION_NAME} `
    /Out '{LOG_PATH}' `
    /DumpResult '{RESULT_PATH}'
```

Remove empty optional keys (`/N`, `/P`, `-Extension`).

Read the verdict from all three signals (`{RESULT_PATH}` = `0`, exit code, `{LOG_PATH}` containing `Конфигурация успешно загружена` / `Configuration successfully loaded`). Wait 5-10 seconds.

## Step 3b. Update DB structure through Designer

```powershell
& '{PLATFORM_PATH}\bin\1cv8.exe' DESIGNER `
    {INFOBASE_FLAG} '{INFOBASE_PATH}' `
    /N '{IB_USER}' `
    /P '{IB_PASSWORD}' `
    /DisableStartupMessages `
    /UpdateDBCfg -Dynamic+ -SessionTerminate force `
    -Extension {EXTENSION_NAME} `
    /Out '{LOG_PATH}' `
    /DumpResult '{RESULT_PATH}'
```

`-SessionTerminate force` forcibly terminates active sessions. It is allowed only after the dev/test confirmation above. On production, remove this key and agree on an update window with the user.

Read the verdict from all three signals (`{RESULT_PATH}`, exit code, `{LOG_PATH}`). On errors, show the relevant log fragment and **do not run** UI tests.

## Step 3c. Applicability check — mandatory when an extension is deployed

Whenever this run loads an extension (`EXTENSION_NAME` filled, or a full-snapshot pass over `EXTENSION_NAMES`), run `/update1cbase → Step 2c` (`content/commands/update1cbase.md` — the `/CheckModules` → `/CheckCanApplyConfigurationExtensions` ladder with the three-signal verdict) **between the load (Step 2) and the DB update (Step 3)**, in the `ibcmd` path as well. Stop at the first failure and do not run Step 3. For the main configuration alone the ladder is optional — run `/CheckConfig` when the change is large (whole-snapshot deploy, release build) or when the Gate 1–3 MCP validators were not exposed in this session.

## Failure handling for Steps 2–3 — retry loop

Apply the **Update retry loop** from `/update1cbase` (`content/commands/update1cbase.md → Update retry loop`) verbatim: read `{LOG_PATH}` after every attempt (diagnostics in the log override exit code 0 — classify the platform's success phrases first, `content/rules/designer-batch-checks.md → The success-phrase trap`); on failure terminate the hung / failed Configurator by its own PID only (never blanket-kill `1cv8` processes); fix the logged cause before any retry (re-running unchanged is forbidden); after a failed load restart from Step 2; at most 3 full attempts, then stop and report. UI tests (Step 4) run only after a clean pass.

## Step 4. UI tests in the web client

UI testing is an **opt-in** step controlled by `UI_TESTING` (values and default — `dev-standards-env.md → "UI_TESTING — web UI-testing mode"`). It burns a lot of tokens, so it is not run by default. Resolve the effective value and act on it:

- **`off`** — skip this step; finish with: "UI tests skipped: web testing is disabled in `.dev.env` (`UI_TESTING=off`)."
- **`manual`** — run this step **only if the user explicitly asked to run UI tests** in the current request. Otherwise skip it and finish with: "UI tests skipped: `UI_TESTING=manual` — run only on explicit request."
- **`auto`** — run this step automatically (subject to the `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL` check below).

If UI testing is to run but `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL` is empty, skip this step and finish with: "UI tests skipped: `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL` is not set in `.dev.env`."

### Step 4a. Browser-tool preflight (before any navigation)

Load `content/rules/ui-testing-tools.md` and run its **Preflight before web UI tests** gate. Short form:

1. Check CLI (`agent-browser --version`) and/or MCP tools (`agent_browser_*`).
2. If missing — **stop**, ask in Russian whether to run `/install-agent-browser` now (saves tokens vs screenshot/vision). Do not open `{INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL}` until the user answers.
3. On yes — execute `/install-agent-browser`, then continue.
4. On no — continue with the built-in browser MCP; note the higher token cost once.
5. Silent skip of this ask = defect.

### Step 4b. Run scenarios

Open `{INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL}` with the tool chosen in 4a. Prefer **`agent-browser`** (a11y snapshots); built-in browser MCP only after decline / no-operator fallback; **`Windows-MCP`** (`/install-windows-mcp`) only for unavoidable desktop / thick-client automation — never as the default for the web client, never a home-grown screenshotter/OCR. Rules:

- Prefer snapshot/refs observe loops over screenshot/vision.
- **MUST** use delayed human-like typing when filling fields.
- Use TAB to move between form fields.
- Wait for elements to load before interacting.
- Take screenshots at key steps for documentation (evidence, not the observe loop).

## Step 5. Final report

Briefly report which infobase was updated, which tool was used (`ibcmd` or Designer), which test scenarios passed/failed, and list errors separately with log fragments and screenshots.

When scenarios failed and the user wants the failures driven to green, do not improvise ad-hoc retries — suggest `/test-fix-loop` (`content/commands/test-fix-loop.md`): the closed deploy → test → fix → redeploy loop with its own iteration budget and no-change-repeat rules. It runs only on explicit invocation.
