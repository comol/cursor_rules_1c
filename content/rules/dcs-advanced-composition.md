description: Advanced programmatic composition in СКД — two-pass preprocessing of detail records before roll-up (hiding zero-total crosstab rows / columns), and executing the composition query directly instead of the DCS output processor for memory-heavy reports. Load only when the standard `ПриКомпоновкеРезультата` override of `standards(name="dcs-design") §5` is not enough.

# СКД — advanced composition techniques

Two techniques that go beyond the standard programmatic override. Both are **escalations**: reach for them only after the ordinary route of `standards(name="dcs-design") §5` (override `ПриКомпоновкеРезультата`, manipulate settings, output through `ПроцессорВыводаРезультатаКомпоновкиДанныхВТабличныйДокумент`) has been shown insufficient. Both give up part of the standard DCS semantics, and that cost is the reason they are not the default.

| Technique | Solves | Gives up |
|---|---|---|
| **Two-pass preprocessing** (§1) | Filtering / transforming **detail records before the engine rolls them up** | A second full composition pass; the schema must stay query-based |
| **Direct query execution** (§2) | Memory blow-up of the DCS engine on large reports; a flat "raw" result | Groupings, conditional appearance, drill-down (расшифровка), DCS totals |
