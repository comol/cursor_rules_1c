# Locks and Transactions — Design Rules

The 1C platform offers two locking subsystems (automatic / managed) and an implicit-transaction model around object writes. Most production lock incidents come from mixing the two, opening unintended transactions, or holding locks across user dialogs. This file is the canonical home for those rules.

> **Scope.** This file owns the design rules. The narrow case "set a lock before reading balances during posting" lives as a worked example in `standards(name="platform-solutions") §9 → "Managed locks and deadlock prevention"` — that section now points back here for the general theory.
