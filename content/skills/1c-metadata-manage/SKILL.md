# 1C Metadata Manage — Skill Dispatch

Use this skill when the task involves **1C metadata structure** (creating, editing, validating, or removing configuration objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions, or databases).

## Hard rule

Any **mutation** of metadata XML — `Configuration.xml`, object XML, `Form.xml`, MXL / SKD layouts, `Role.xml`, subsystems, command interfaces — is executed **through this skill** (dispatch below → domain doc → PowerShell tools) or through the `1c-metadata-manager` subagent. The tools under `tools/` handle BOM, encodings, UUID regeneration, `ChildObjects` ordering and cross-references that are easy to break manually. Hand-editing these files while the skill is available is a **defect** (`AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents`), not a slower-but-acceptable alternative.

The same gate covers **infobase operations** (create / run, load / dump configuration, `/UpdateDBCfg`, web publication): use the `db-ops` / `web-ops` tools of this skill ([db-manage.md](docs/db-manage.md), [web-manage.md](docs/web-manage.md)) or the matching slash command (`/update1cbase`, `/loadfrom1cbase`, `/getconfigfiles`, `/deploy-and-test`) — never an ad-hoc `1cv8.exe` / `ibcmd` command line composed from memory. DB updates follow the iterative retry discipline (`db-manage.md → Update retry discipline`).

The only exceptions:

- **Unambiguous one-line fix** of an existing value that cannot break structure — a synonym / comment typo, a boolean flag flip on an existing element. Anything that adds / removes / reorders elements, touches UUIDs, or spans more than one line of XML is not "one-line".
- **Skill not available in the session** (files not installed / not exposed) — state it once in one line, then hand-edit with `metadata-xml-workarounds.md` loaded and validate per `verification-gates.md → Gate 5`.
- **Read-only analysis** of metadata XML is not a mutation — reading files directly is fine (subject to `mcp-first-search.md` for locating them).

## Vendor support gate

Every mutating tool of this skill refuses to edit an object of a **typical configuration on vendor support** that is locked ("на замке"), and refuses to delete one that has not been taken off support. This is not advisory: the run exits `1` with a diagnostic. Editing such an object directly breaks future vendor updates silently, so the refusal is the correct outcome, not an obstacle to route around by hand-editing the XML.

The default answer when a typical object needs a change is an **extension** (`cfe-borrow` / `cfe-patch-method`) — support state stays untouched and updates keep working. Deliberately changing support state is the `support-edit` tool. Both paths, plus the `SUPPORT_GUARD` modes in `.dev.env` (`deny` — default / `warn` / `off`), are in [support-manage.md](docs/support-manage.md).

In every case the post-edit validation (`verify_xml` / skill validation scripts) still applies. When reporting a task that mutated metadata / forms / layouts, name the path used in one line (`Metadata tooling: <tool / subagent>` or `hand-edit — <exception>`) per `AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents`.

## Path conventions

PowerShell examples in this skill (`SKILL.md` and every `docs/*.md`) use the prefix `skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`. That prefix is **relative to the active tool's skills directory**, not to the repository root:

- After installation: the script lives under `<tool>/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...` (e.g. `.cursor/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.claude/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.kilo/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.ai-agent/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`). Active tools that load this skill resolve the prefix automatically.
- In the `1c-rules` source repository (when editing the skill itself): the same script lives under `content/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`. Prepend `content/` when running the example outside of an installed project.

The same convention applies to `docs/*.md` references like `skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/1c-skd-info/modes-reference.md`.

## Dispatch Strategy

Determine task complexity, then choose the execution mode:

### Direct execution — simple / read-only tasks

Use when the task is a **single lightweight query**: checking metadata info, a quick lookup, one validation call. In this case identify the task domain from the table below, read the corresponding file, and follow its instructions directly.

### Subagent delegation — complex / mutation tasks

Delegate to the **`1c-metadata-manager`** subagent (defined in `content/agents/metadata-manager.md`, or in the installed agents directory for the active tool) when **any** of the following is true:

- The task **creates, scaffolds, or compiles** metadata (objects, forms, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, CF, CFE, databases)
- The task **edits multiple files** or **spans multiple domains**
- The task involves a **multi-step workflow** (create → edit → validate → fix → re-validate)
- The task requires **reading large domain docs** (forms, meta-manage, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, DB — each 200–800 lines)

The subagent already knows how to read the skill docs, execute PowerShell scripts, and validate results. Provide it with the full task description including object names, attributes, types, and any business context from the conversation.
